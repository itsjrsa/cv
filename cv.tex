\section{Awards and Honors}

\datedsubsection{EEM2016 - COMPLATT - Energy Price Forecast Competition}{April 2017}


International competition\footnote{\url{http://complatt.smartwatt.net/}} with the demanding exercise of forecasting the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) hourly spot energy price up to 120 hours ahead. In a rolling basis fashion, forecasts were submitted over a period of 14 days. A weighted mean absolute error metric was used to evaluate the forecasts of each participant.

\begin{myitemize}
	\item Final Classification: 4\textsuperscript{th} place (44 participants at final stage)
